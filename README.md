## Description

Simulate playing (losing) the lottery! Here the U.S. multi state lottery game Mega Millions is simulated. You choose how many tickets you want to play (quick-picks, basically) and then how many games you want to play. Then, it plays all the games and tells you how much money you (probably) wasted playing the lottery.

## Setup and Usage

Download the latest release, unzip to folder of your choosing. You can just run LotterySimulator.exe from that folder or use setup.exe if you can to install it.

First option is to choose how many tickets you want to buy. This is equivalent to getting 'quick-pick' and your numbers are randomly generated.

Second option is how many games you want to play with those tickets. MegaMillions (and PowerBall) games are drawn twice a week, so the number you choose here is 1/2 the number of weeks you want to play.
