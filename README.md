# LotterySimulator

Simuilate playing (losing) the lottery! Here the U.S. multistate lottery game MegaMillions is simulated. You choose how many tickets you want to play (quick-picks, basically) and then how many games you want to play. Then, it plays all the games and tells you how much money you (probably) wasted playing the lottery.
